The Geometry Calculator (Module File)

This is the first of two files for your assignment. This file should be saved
as `geometry.py`.

This file will be your module. It should not be run directly.
Its only job is to define functions that can be used by another script.

Instructions:
1.  Add the `import math` statement at the top, as you will need it for the
    circle calculation.
2.  Complete the function definitions below. Each function should `return` the
    calculated area. Do not use `print()` statements inside these functions.

    Calculates the area of a square.
    Formula: area = side * side

    """
    Calculates the area of a rectangle.
