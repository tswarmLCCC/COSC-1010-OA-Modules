The Geometry Calculator (Main Script)

This is the second of two files for your assignment. This file should be saved
as `main.py`. This is the script that the user will run.

Instructions:
Follow the steps outlined in the comments below to complete the program.
"""

# 1. Import your `geometry` module.
#    Make sure `geometry.py` is in the same folder as this file.


# 2. Print a welcome message for the user.


# 3. Ask the user for their choice of shape.
#    Store their answer in a variable. Use .lower() to make it case-insensitive.


# 4. Use an if/elif/else block to determine which shape they chose.

# 5. If they chose "square":
#    a. Ask the user for the side length (and convert it to a float).
#    b. Call the `area_of_square` function from your geometry module.
#    c. Print the result in a user-friendly sentence.

# 6. If they chose "rectangle":
#    a. Ask the user for the length and width (as floats).
#    b. Call the `area_of_rectangle` function.
#    c. Print the result.

# 7. If they chose "circle":
#    a. Ask for the radius (as a float).
#    b. Call the `area_of_circle` function.
#    c. Print the result, perhaps formatted to 2 decimal places.

# 8. If they entered an invalid shape, print an error message.
